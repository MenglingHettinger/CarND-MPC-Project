1. Describe the model in detail.

MPC model predict the change in the dependent variables (state) of the system that will cause the change in the indepedent variables (actuators). 
At time t the current state is sampled and a cost minimizing control strategy is computed (via a numerical minimization algorithm) for a relatively short time horizon in the future: t+T.

Vehicle location (x, y), vehicle pose (phi), vehicle velocity (v), crosstrack error(cte) and acceleration (a) at time t + T is calculated using the values from t. A set of constrains are also given for a given system. The cost function is defined by adding 1) errors in crosstrack, heading angle and velocity 2) actuations values and 3) the sudden change in actuators. 

The model is:
x_t+1 = x_t + v_t * cos(phi_t) * dt
y_t+1 = y_t + v_t * sin(phi_t) * dt
phi_t+1 = phi_t + v_t/Lf * delta_t * dt
v_t+1 = v_t + a_t * dt
cte_t+1 = f(x_t) - y_t+ (v_t * sin(epsi_t) * dt)
epsi_t+1 = phi_t - epsi + (v_t/Lf * delta_t * dt)


with constraints:
delta = [ -0.436332, 0.436332]
a = [-1, 1]



2. Choice of Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt).

If the N is too big and dt is too small, it will take a long time to compute the MPC. If N is too small and dt is too big, the accuracy of the model will not be good. The final value chosed for N = 10 and dt = 0.1, which means the optimizer is considering a 1 sec data for determining the trajectory. 

3. Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
Prior to the MPC precedure, waypoints were transformed to vehicle coordinates and shifted by the vehicle location. By doing this, the host vehicle will be at location (0, 0). 


4. Model Predictive Control with Latency
The kinetic equation has been modified to take into account the values 2 timestamps ago.
